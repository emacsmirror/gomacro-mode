# gomacro-mode

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This Emacs package provides bindings for working with [Gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro), a read eval print loop for Go.
It aims to provide some of the most used features in Slime etc.


## TODO

- [x] Combine eval region and eval region verbose to one function with config param
- [x] Add gomacro-eval-buffer
- [ ] Add gomacro-eval-last-expression (C-x C-e)
- [ ] Eval region in temporary buffer to avoid view changing
- [ ] Handle package declarations
